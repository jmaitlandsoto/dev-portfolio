    description: `In this project, I had the exciting challenge of creating a dynamic and streamlined website for F.O.A.C. Technical Manufacturing and Training Corp., a powerhouse of mechanical engineering expertise. The goal was to craft a user-friendly platform to spotlight FOAC's global work, unique skillset, and unwavering dedication to Africa's sustainable industrial development. The website serves as a digital stage for the accomplished team, showcasing their talents and backgrounds, and shining a spotlight on their forward-thinking founder, Joseph Amankrah. It's a vibrant, engaging gateway into the world of FOAC, providing visitors with an instant grasp of their transformative work and ambitious vision.`,

    title: "Algorithm Visualizer",
    description: `I've always found those algorithm visualization videos on Youtube super satisfying to watch, so in an attempt to better grasp basic sorting algorithms I took a stab at coding them myself, but took it a step further and used Pygame to visualize them. I then figured out how to host the program on a website called trinket.io, so go on and check out the demo.`,
